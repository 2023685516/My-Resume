		<h3>English Day Carnival — Form 1</h3>
		<p>In Form 1, my classmates and I took the initiative to run our own booth for the English Day Carnival. We carefully designed a word-syllable matching game that surprisingly became one of the liveliest and most engaging activities at the event. Throughout the process, I learned how to plan and manage a booth effectively, communicate and interact with a variety of visitors, and coordinate responsibilities within a team. This experience not only taught me organizational skills but also gave me a glimpse into leadership and the importance of creating activities that are both educational and enjoyable.</p>

		<h3>Sports House Marching — Form 2</h3>
		<p>During Form 2, I had the honor of representing my Green Sports House in the school marching event. While the performance may have seemed simple to an outside observer, the preparation involved hours of disciplined practice, coordination with my teammates, and consistent effort to perfect every step and formation. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of precision, timing, and commitment. I also learned how collaborative teamwork can turn individual effort into a unified and impressive group performance, reinforcing both patience and perseverance.</p>

		<h3>School Kiosk Part-Time — Form 2</h3>
		<p>In the same year, I also worked part-time at my school’s kiosk.

Although the job seemed simple on the surface, it was a great opportunity to develop practical skills such as customer service, responsibility, and effective communication.
